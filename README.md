# language-cwl-atom
Allows Atom to recognize CWL as a language.

Really, I just copied the Atom core YAML grammar files and then tweaked them to work with CWL-specific syntax.

Currently, the way to use this atom package is to clone this repo and then use `apm link` to link it into your atom package directory.

You will also probably want to install https://github.com/SolomonShorser-OICR/cwl-solarized-dark as this is a syntax theme that has CWL-specific highlighting.
